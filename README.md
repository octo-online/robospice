Overview
--------

RoboSpice is a modular android library that makes writing asynchronous network requests *easy*.

Main features of RoboSpice
--------------------------
* supports Android starting *_from_ SDK version 8 (Froyo / 2.2.x)* 
* executes network requests **asynchronously** (in a background AndroidService)
* supports **REST** out of the box (using [Spring Android](http://www.springsource.org/spring-android) or [Google Http Client](http://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client)).
* is strongly typed ! You query webservices using **POJOs** and you get POJOs as request results.
* enforces no constraints neither on POJOs used for requests nor on Activity classes you use in your projects
* **caches results** in Json with both [Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) or [Jackson2](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease20) or [Gson](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/),
or [Xml](http://simple.sourceforge.net/), or flat text files, or binary files, even using [ORM Lite](http://ormlite.com/sqlite_java_android_orm.shtml) (still in beta)
* notifies your activities (or any other context) of the result of the network request **with respect to their lifecycles**.
* **no memory leaks** at all, like Android Loaders, unlike Android AsyncTasks
* notifies your activities on their **UI Thread**
* uses a simple but **robust** exception handling model
* supports **multi-threading** of request executions
* supports aggregation of different web services
* is a full featured replacement for long running AsyncTasks even they are not related to networking.
* is **open source** ;) 
* and **tested** (more than 160 tests)

RoboSpice is under Continuous Integration [on a CloudBees server](https://robospice.ci.cloudbees.com/job/Build-RoboSpice/) and [on a Travis server](https://travis-ci.org/octo-online/robospice/builds) Thanks to CloudBees and Travis.

Example code & demo
-------------------

The RoboSpice team proposes a lot of sample applications in [their own GitHub repo](https://github.com/octo-online/RoboSpice-samples).

We also propose a few demo : 
* [RoboSpice Motivations](http://goo.gl/pzqH4) : a pedagogical app that explains the motivations behind RoboSpice.
* and [a demo that illustrates non-network related requests (offline)](](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.octo.android.robospice.sample.offline#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDIxMiwiY29tLm9jdG8uYW5kcm9pZC5yb2Jvc3BpY2Uuc2FtcGxlLm9mZmxpbmUiXQ..).
